A small project based on the game Agar.io to teach myself Darkrift functionality and experiment with various networking
 concepts such as client-side prediction, lag compensation and integrated servers.
 
When cloning, pull the AgarPlugin folder into an external folder to prevent what can only be described as a litany of errors occuring.
